    <p>We, the students of The Evergreen State College, are petitioning for permission to set up an on-campus development server.</p>
    <p>Such a server would provide a local environment for coding, testing, cyber security scenarios, and web publishing. This would enhance the learning potential of students while reducing our reliance on costly Microsoft services.</p>
    <p>We formally request that The Evergreen State College allocate resources to house, connect, and power an on-campus development server. This server should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be accessible to students through a variety of protocols (e.g. SSH, SFTP, VNC, HTTPS, etc.)</li>
      <li>Provide sufficient computational resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to support a variety of virtualization</li>
  and development tasks.
      <li>Be capable of hosting student projects and websites.</li>
    </ul>
