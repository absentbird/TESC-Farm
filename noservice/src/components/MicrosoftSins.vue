      Destruction of Clean Water
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>Every year trillions of gallons of fresh potable water are evaporated in Microsoft datacenters, and the rate is only increasing.</p>
      <p>Microsoft favors evaporative cooling because it lowers their power bill, instead of installing additional solar panels they opt to turn the water into hot mist.</p>
      <p>Evaporative cooling is most effective in the most arid regions, which are also the ones in which potable water is the most scarce.</p>
      <p>The effect of this is that rivers have begun to run dry, destabilizing the ecosystem and threatening the livelihoods of people in the surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>The loss of a river is difficult for any ecosystem, but in dry climates it can mean the difference between life and death for entire species.</p>

      Wasting Electricity
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>Microsoft uses terawatts of power every year to run their overbuilt datacenters, and it's only getting worse.</p>
      <p>It's hard to fathom the level of power consumption, and we don't even know the full picture. They used over 30 terawatt-hours in 2024, and consumption has only gone up since. For comparison the entire city of Seattle collectively used less than 9 terawatt-hours over the same time period.</p>
      <p>It would be one thing if they were getting this power from renewable sources, but Microsoft prefers to use natural gas reactors which depend on fracking and leak methane into the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>In addition to their gas burners, Microsoft is also reviving the Three Mile Island reactor, which famously melted down and increased the cancer rate in the area for decades.</p>

      E-Waste
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>An estimated 240 million perfectly functional devices will be disposed of due to Microsoft's hardware requirements for Windows 11, combined with their discontinuation of support for Windows 10</p>
      <p>Microsoft has a profit motive to require an upgrade; for many consumers the only time Microsoft gets paid is when they buy a computer with Windows pre-loaded.</p>
      <p>It doesn't have to be this way. Linux is both more performant and secure, and at no point did it set arbitrary hardware requirements that force users to choose between throwing away a working device or risking their security.</p>
      <p>The volume of waste just from this single decision is in the millions, possibly billions, of tons; tons of metals and plastic, resources that could continue to be used instead of filling up landfills and slowly leeching toxins into the earth.</p>

      Spying on You
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>It's hard to overstate how much Microsoft spies on their customers. Every Windows 11 PC takes regular screenshots to be sent to HQ and analyzed by AI. Every GitHub repo is fed into the training data for Copilot and ChatGPT.</p>
      <p>They use everything you do on your computer to sell you ads, piping them directly into your OS to inflate their bottom line.</p>
      <p>Microsoft doesn't just spy for their own benefit, they also collaborate with organizations like ICE and law enforcement.</p>

      Azure Apartheid
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>To call Microsoft an ally of Israel would be an understatement. They have partnered with the IDF, collecting petabytes of data collected through illegal spying operations. All the phone records and text massages of the people of Gaza were then fed through an AI to select targets.</p>
      <p>Project Lavender was the name given to this system, an automated algorithm that decided who lived and died based on math and vibes.</p>
      <p>In addition to directly assisting the occupation and genocide in Gaza, Microsoft also matched donations to fund illegal settlements in the West Bank; they offered no such matching for people who donated to feed the starving people of Palestine.</p>
      <p>Israel's military intelligence unit, Unit 8200, used Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to store recordings of millions of phone calls made by Palestinians. This data was allegedly used for blackmail, detention, and targeting.</p>

      Embrace Extend Extinguish
    </v-expansion-panel-title>
    <v-expansion-panel-text>
      <p>Microsoft has long been an enemy of free software.</p>
      <p>While serving as CEO, Steve Ballmer had this to say about Linux: "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches." They literally hate us for our freedom, and will stop at nothing to lock us down in their proprietary systems.</p>
      <p>In the 90s, during an anti-trust lawsuit challenging Microsoft's monopolistic practices of restricting browser choice to force Internet Explorer down people's throats, Microsoft was forced to divulge internal documents that spelled out their system for destroying free software:</p>
      <ol class="mb-4">
        <li><strong>Embrace:</strong> Development of software substantially compatible with an Open Standard.</li>
        <li><strong>Extend:</strong> Addition of features not supported by the Open Standard, creating interoperability problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Extinguish:</strong> When extensions become a de facto standard because of their dominant market share, they marginalize competitors who are unable to support the new extensions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Microsoft wants to own the internet, and they don't care how much they destroy in their mad economic conquest.</p>
