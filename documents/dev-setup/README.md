# Development Environment Setup
It helps to have a local environment to test your code. This document is meant to assist in getting a copy of the codebase running on your own computer for testing and development.

## Initial Setup
Before we can execute the code we need a shell to run it in. Essentially we need a terminal to run commands in. If you aren't familiar with the command line or text interfaces don't worry. Everything you need will need to type into the terminal will be listed on this page to be easily copied and pasted.

### Linux
Congratulations, Linux makes this simple. If you don't know how to open the terminal you can probably find it in your launcher menu by searching for `terminal`, many distributions also have a hotkey to open the terminal: `Ctrl + Alt + t` works on most systems, including Ubuntu and Fedora.

Use the terminal to install

### Windows
It's technically possible to use the `cmd` application in Windows, but the amount of extra work needed to make it work is simply not worth it, especially when it's become so easy to get a genuine BASH shell on Windows.
