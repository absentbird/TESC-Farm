# Wash Station Data Foundation Timeline
This doubles as a curriculum timeline for Student Learning contracts. 

## Weeks 1-2: Preparation and Initial Setup
-   Obtain necessary approvals from school administration and relevant authorities. ##first meetings for the aproval process were in early december.
-   Source suppliers and place orders for required components.
-   Prepare the installation site (cleaning, ensuring accessibility).
-   Prepare Maintenance doc to prepare for added pictures, video, and learning experiences over the course of deployment.
-   Complete development and testing of software needed to suport the PI, Data, farm worker UX and farm supervisor UX.

## Weeks 3-6: Component Installation and Integration
-   Receive and inspect components once they arrive.
-   Install solar panels and verify proper power generation.
-   Begin initial setup of Raspberry Pi (install OS, necessary software, and initial configuration).
-   install scales and connect them to Raspberry Pi for data collection.
-   Set up the tablet and ensure it can interface with the Raspberry Pi.
-   Test wireless bridge for stable internet connectivity and integrate with Raspberry Pi.
-   Integrate all components into the wash station system.
-   Perform preliminary testing to ensure all components are functioning correctly.

## Weeks 7-10: System Testing and Training
-   Conduct comprehensive system testing, including data collection from scales and communication between Raspberry Pi, tablet, and wireless bridge.
-   Train farm workers on how to use the new system.
-   Document the entire setup process and any troubleshooting steps.

## Final Deliverables
